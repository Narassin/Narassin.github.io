my first repository dated 6-3-2018

Hello Non-primate being,
  Narassin here, I like gamers.java and mmorpg.html(these what led me to start learning coding).
Although its called Darwin's Evolution theory but the media is really taking it as a fact rather than a theory.
I just finish school and exploring the beautiful language of logic and rythm(as in literal poetry and rap).
As for this moment in history (which is exactly 10:57pm 6/3/2018 Tuesday night) I,Narassin, shall start his journey into 
programing.
